Student-Athlete Declaration of Medical Condition Acknowledgement</b></p></div>

<p>I, #FIRST_NAME# #LAST_NAME#, am aware that participation as a
student-athlete in #SPORT# puts me at risk for serious injuries and/or
medical conditions.  I understand that sharing information with Miami
Universityâ€™s medical staff is important to helping maintain my safety,
and I agree to the following instructions:</p>

<ul>

<li>Before I start practice, I will inform the Miami University Sports
Medicine Department about any injury, orthopedic issue, and/or general
medical condition in order to receive appropriate medical
attention.</li>

<li>In the event that I develop any injury, orthopedic issue and/or
general medical condition during my sports season, I will immediately
inform the Miami University Sports Medicine Department in order to
receive appropriate medical attention.</li>

<li>I will be responsible for disclosing any injury, orthopedic issue
and/or general medical condition during my Exit Physical Examination
which I must schedule with Miami University Sports Medicine before the
end of the academic year and/or athletic competitive season (whichever
is later) in which I have exhausted my athletic eligibility or opted
to discontinue participation in intervarsity athletics (whichever is
sooner).</li>

</ul>

<p>I understand that if I fail to disclose any known or suspected
injury, orthopedic issue and/or general medical condition to the Miami
University Sports Medicine Department and seek medical treatment then
I release Miami University from any and all responsibility and
liability for such injuries/medical condition(s).</p>
