<p>I have read and understood the following statements about my rights:</p>

revocation will not affect any action the disclosing entity took
before it received the revocation.  In addition, I may revoke this
Authorization at any time prior to its expiration date by notifying
the Miami University, Head Athletic Trainer, in writing, who will then
forward such notice to any entities who previously received the

However, such revocation will not affect any actions the disclosing
entities took before they received the notice from the Miami
University Department of Intercollegiate Athletics.</li>

<li>A health care provider may not condition my treatment or payment
for health care upon whether I sign this Authorization, unless the

may no longer be protected by federal privacy rules such as HIPAA.
The information disclosed may be redisclosed by the receiving entity.
By signing below, I specifically authorize such redisclosure.</li>
