<p>
Once athlete records are archived, they are to remain in the database
for a period of 7 years following the archiving.  After this time,
they may be purged from the database permanently.  This utility
permits an Intranet user with ADMIN clearance to do precisely this.
Note that even after an athlete's record is purged, it will still
exist on the backup tapes, and therefore can be recovered in the event
of an emergency or a mistake.
