    STATEMENT</strong></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The mission of the Miami University Sports Medicine Department is to
    create and maintain an environment which will provide: (a) an avenue for sports medicine
    practitioners to successfully provide the care, prevention and rehabilitation of athletic
    injuries and (b) the opportunity for student athletic trainers to become competent in the
    theories, techniques and practices of Athletic Training. To achieve this, several areas
    will need to be addressed.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. Each staff member must constantly strive to stay abreast of the
    changes in Sports Medicine so that the quality of care will continue to improve. This will
    require continued acquisition of clinical and academic knowledge through meetings,
    seminars, clinics and information derived from the information network from within the
    profession.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. Each Sports Medicine staff member must look at the tasks to be done
    and determine what they are uniquely qualified to do and what can be delegated to another
    member of the staff. At no time should a staff member delegate a task to a person who is
    not uniquely qualified for such a task. The staff must recognize that their decisions not
    only affect them but will affect the rest of the staff as well. Therefore, it is important
    that each staff member look at their tasks as vitally important and carry them out or
    request support from the rest of the staff. A decision can then be made by the Head
    Athletic Trainer and the Director of Sports Medicine as to the priority of the tasks. We
    must work to create an environment in which student athletic trainers are competent and
    self confident enough to carry out some of the other duties which would take us away from
    that which only we are qualified to do and to provide the student-athlete trainers the
    avenues by which they may achieve certification in the NATA and employment in athletic
    training.</td>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Miami University Sports Medicine Department provides for the
    prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of athletic injuries under the direction of our
    team physicians and in particular the Director of Sports Medicine. The Yager Stadium
    training room serves field hockey, softball, men's &amp; women's soccer, men's and women's
    track and field, men's and women's cross country and football. The Withrow training room
    serves wrestling, baseball, men's and women's swimming/diving, men's &amp; women's tennis
    and golf. The Millett training room serves men's and women's basketball and volleyball.
    The Goggin Ice Arena training room serves ice hockey and synchronized skating. Specific hours
    for each facility are posted at the entrance doors. Although each training room serves
    specific sports it should be noted that any athlete is welcome in any of the training
    facilities. The Withrow Court training room is also the location where morning treatments
    are held unless other arrangements are made.</td>

    <p>D. The Athletic Insurance Policy provides coverage for student athletes injured while
    participating in the play or practice of an intercollegiate sport.</p>
    <p>E. The Athletic Insurance Policy provides secondary coverage only. If at the time of
    injury the student athlete is not covered by a primary insurance policy they will be held
    responsible for the deductible on the Athletic Insurance Policy which is currently
    $2000.00.</p>
    <p>F. The Athletic Insurance Policy cannot provide benefits for pre-existing conditions.

    <p><strong>H. Proper documentation in the form of itemized bills and EOBs (explanation of

    equipment staff and returned prior to each practice. Any athlete wearing personal
    equipment, sweats, gloves etc. must make sure that this equipment is laundered prior to
    each practice.</p>
    <p>7. A solution of Q-Zene (or similar solution) will be made available in the wrestling
    room by the trainer for cleaning the exercise bikes and equipment following each use.</p>
    <p>8. A list of athletes with a history of skin infections will be given to the Strength
    and Conditioning Coordinator (Dan Dairymple) and shall be updated daily so that special
    cleaning of the weight room equipment can take place following those athletes' workouts.</p>
    <p>9. The training room personnel will take the following added precaution when dealing
    with people with histories of or suspicion of skin infections.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(a) Do not re-use ice bags.<br>
      (b) Hot pack covers laundered prior to use by another athlete.<br>
      (c) Tables cleaned prior to use by another athlete.<br>
      (d) Modality pads cleaned prior to use by another athlete.<br>
      (e) Whirlpools cleaned prior to use by another athlete.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In addition, all athletes with a history of skin susceptible conditions will be
    evaluated by Dr. Dailey on a yearly basis (prior to the season's start) and placed on
    medicine prophylacticly if deemed appropriate.</p>
    <p>Any student athlete who reports a skin condition must be evaluated by a physician prior
    to practice. The wrestling trainer in conjunction with the team physician will make a
    determination as to the practice status of the athlete.</td>

    <p>Recognizing that athletes require year round attention to their medical needs and that
    administrative tasks must be accomplished in a timely fashion, the Sports Medicine
    department has established the following policy to assure that all staff has adequate time
    off while continuing to function on a 12 month calendar.</p>
    <p>1. School year - Vacation time can be taken during the academic year if the staff
    trainer's teams are not practicing and in the judgement of the Head Athletic Trainer
    quality care can be provided to all athletes in the staff member's absence.</p>
    <p>2. Summer - The staff is encouraged to take vacation during this period. Requests will
    be reviewed and approved by the Head Athletic Trainer under the following guidelines.<ul>
      <p>a. Adequate staffing of the facilities for summer treatment must be maintained.<br>
      b. Continued communication about any ongoing problems that they have regardless of their
      vacation status. This means that the staff trainer on vacation must either communicate
      appropriately to staff on duty or communicate directly to the athlete and coach via phone
      in their absence.</p>
    </ul>
    <p>3. In general, staff are expected to be gone no more than two consecutive weeks. This
    will insure that the staff member has a chance to check the status of his or her athletes
    and to get caught up on administrative duties.</p>
    <p>4. All staff are required to submit vacation leave requests with the athletic
    department with a copy of this request to the Head Athletic Trainer.</p>
    <p>5. Professional development time will not be counted against vacation time provided
    that the Head Athletic Trainer and/or the Director of Sports Medicine is satisfied that
    the activity will enhance the sports medicine program.</td>
