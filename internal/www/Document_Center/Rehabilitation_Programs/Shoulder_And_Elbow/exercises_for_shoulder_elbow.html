<p><a name="Prevention"></a><big><strong>PREVENTION</strong></big></p>

<p><strong>Year Round Conditioning and Post Injury Maintenance</strong></p>

<p>Essential to ball players is an off season program and year round conditioning. Players
who are injured during spring training as a result of poor conditioning come to the
realization that they cannot expect to get in shape right before spring training and throw
well without having a high risk of injury. Players should progress back gradually so that
they are not throwing &quot;too hard, too fast, too far, or too quickly&quot;,
predisposing themselves to injury. Off season conditioning programs address conditioning,
strength training, and flexibility. It is of utmost importance that a structured program
be followed. A year round program helps to prevent injury and a maintenance program helps
to prevent reoccurrence.</p>

<p>Flexibility and stability of the shoulder is paramount in the dynamic throwing act. The
joint capsule must allow range of motion and flexibility in order to provide a fluid
delivery. Flexibility exercises should be performed before and after throwing and should
also be performed in conjunction with any weight training program. A good balance between
the anterior and posterior musculature must exist so that the shoulder will not be
predisposed to injury. In addition to any additional strengthening that a player may
perform, special emphasis must be given to the posterior musculature (i.e. the rotator
cuff).</p>

<hr>

<p><a name="Rehabilitation"></a><big><strong>REHABILITATION</strong></big></p>

<p><strong>Rehabilitative Goals</strong></p>

<p>The goal of any rehabilitation program is that of returning to an optimal pre-injury
status. The components of a good rehabilitation program are directed towards achieving
full range of motion, improving flexibility, increasing strength, and regaining power,
coordination, endurance, accuracy, and timing for the activity. The excessive demand and
stress of throwing may lead to a spectrum of injuries ranging from minimum to maximum
severity of pathology. Mild injuries with resultant inflammatory response and symptomatic
pain may lead to a moderate or severe chronic problem if continued over demand is placed
upon the shoulder without appropriate treatment in the early phase of injury. Mild overuse
injuries, such as musculature strains, tendinitis, or bursitis, respond well to a period
of rest from activity: conservative measures and modality treatments, such as ice,
electrical muscle stimulation, moist heat, ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical nerve
stimulation, anti-inflammatories, exercise, and a gradual return to activity. If a
continued overuse problem becomes chronic and severe, a cycle may result of increased pain
and inflammation leading to shoulder tightness, muscular weakness and imbalance with
additional problems of compensation and activity which increases abnormal biomechanics.</p>

<p>Loss of shoulder and elbow flexibility results from muscle tenderness, tightness,
and/or capsular tightness. Inflexibility of the glenohumeral joint of the injured throwing
shoulder can be assessed in positions of horizontal adduction and combined adduction and
external rotation with the scapula stabilized. With loss of flexibility, movement is tight
at the end range with a deficit of motion as compared to the uninjured extremity. A
thrower needs full range of motion with good flexibility in movement positions.</p>

<p>Goals of increasing strength and endurance in integrated muscle action of the athlete
are accomplished by a <em>high repetition - low weight program</em>. Five sets of 10
repetitions are performed of each specific exercise outlined for the individual. Weight
progression and rehabilitation of the injured throwing arm is initially a gradual increase
beginning without weight on active movements and increasing from one to five pounds in
weight. The exercises are performed in a concentric/eccentric manner with a slow lifting
and a slow lowering technique. The strength/endurance exercises are performed three times
daily. Heavier weights and weight training machines, which may be used in strength
programs for the normal shoulder, should not be used in the case of the injured shoulder
until full range of motion, flexibility, strength, and throwing capabilities have been
achieved.</p>

<p><a name="Interval_Throwing_Program_For_Baseball_Players"></a><big><strong>INTERVAL
THROWING PROGRAM FOR BASEBALL PLAYERS</strong></big></p>

<p>The Interval Throwing Program is designed to gradually return motion, strength and
confidence in the throwing arm after injury or surgery by slowly progressing through
graduated throwing distances. This program was set up to minimize the chance of re-injury
and emphasizes pre-throwing warm-up and stretching. In development of the interval
throwing program, the following factors are considered most important. 

<ol>
  <li>The act of throwing the baseball involves the transfer of energy from the feet through
    the legs, pelvis, trunk and out the shoulder through the elbow and hand. Therefore, any
    return to throwing after injury must include attention to the entire body.</li>
  <li>The chance for re-injury is lessened by a graduated progression of interval throwing.</li>
  <li>Proper warm-up is essential.</li>
  <li>Most injuries occur as the result of fatigue.</li>
  <li>Proper throwing mechanics lessen the incident of re-injury.</li>
  <li>Baseline requirements for throwing include a pain-free range of motion of all joints
    involved in throwing and adequate muscle power and resistance to fatigue.</li>
</ol>

<p>Because there is an individual variability in all throwing athletes, there is no set
timetable for completion of the program. Most athletes, by nature, are highly competitive
individuals and wish to return to competition at the earliest possible moment. While this
is a necessary quality of all athletes, the proper channeling of the athlete&#146;s
energies into a rigidly controlled throwing program is essential to lessen the chance of
re-injury during the rehabilitative period. The athlete may have the tendency to want to
increase the intensity of the throwing program. This will increase the incidence of
re-injury and may greatly retard the rehabilitation process. It is recommended to follow
the program rigidly as this will be the safest route to return to competition.</p>

<p>During the recovery process the athlete will probably experience soreness and a dull,
diffuse aching sensation in the muscles and tendons. If the athlete experiences sharp
pain, particularly in the joint, stop all throwing activity until this pain ceases.
Throwing should also be discontinued if the athlete&#146;s elbow becomes swollen. Heat on
the shoulder or elbow may help loosen the athlete up prior to throwing. Ice alone, is
recommended after throwing or to treat swelling.</p>

<p><strong>Weight Training:</strong><br>
The athlete may wish to supplement the Interval Throwing Program with a high repetition,
low weight exercise program. Weight training will not increase throwing velocity, but will
increase the resistance of the arm to fatigue and injury. If the athlete uses weight
training this should be done on alternate days with throwing on days in between. Since
weight lifting tends to tighten the joints, it must be stressed that weight training is of
no benefit unless accompanied by a sound flexibility program.</p>

<p><strong>Individual Variability:</strong><br>
The Interval Throwing Program is designed so that each level is achieved without pain or
complication before the next level is started. The reasons for being in the Interval
Throwing Program will vary from person to person. Therefore, the time to successfully
complete each step will vary from person to person. Example: One athlete may wish to use
alternate days throwing with or without using weights in between: another athlete may have
to throw every third or fourth day due to pain or swelling. &quot;Listen to your body - it
will tell you when to slow down.&quot; Again, completion of the steps of the Interval
Throwing Program will vary from person to person. There is no set timetable in terms of
days to completion.</p>

<p><strong>Warm-up:</strong><br>
Jogging increases blood flow to muscles and joints thus increasing their flexibility and
decreasing the chance for injury. Since the amount of warm-up will vary from person to
person, the athlete should jog until developing a light sweat, then progress to the
stretching phase.</p>

<p><strong>Stretching:</strong><br>
Since throwing involves all muscles in the body, all muscle groups should be stretched
prior to throwing. This should be done in a systematic fashion beginning with the legs and
including the trunk, back, neck and arms.</p>

<p><strong>Throwing Mechanics:</strong><br>
By using the Crow Hop method (hop, skip, throw), the throwing arm is placed in a
mechanically sound position for throwing. This throwing method should be adopted from the
onset so that it will become second nature to the athlete. Throwing flat-footed encourages
improper body mechanics, places increased stress on the throwing arm, and predisposes the
arm to re-injury.</p>

<p><strong>Throwing:</strong><br>
Using the Crow-Hop method, begin warm-up throws at a comfortable distance (app. 30-45 ft.)
and then progress to the distance indicated for that phase. The object of each phase is
for the athlete to be able to throw the ball without pain the specified number of feet
(45ft., 90ft., 120ft., 150ft., 180ft.), 50 times at each set. The objective is not to
throw the ball hard, but just to get it there. After the athlete can throw 180 ft. 50
times without pain he will be ready for unrestricted throwing. At this point, full
strength and confidence should be restored in the athlete&#146;s arm. It is important to
stress the Crow-Hop method and proper mechanics with each throw. Once again, if the
athlete experiences sharp pain, particularly in the joint, all throwing should be stopped
until the pain ceases.</p>
