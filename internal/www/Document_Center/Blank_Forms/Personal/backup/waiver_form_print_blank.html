<p align="left">I am aware that playing or practicing to play/participate in any sport can
be a dangerous activity involving MANY RISKS OF INJURY.&nbsp; I understand that the
dangers and risks of playing or practicing to play/participate in the above sport include,
but are not limited to, death, serious neck and spinal injuries which may result in
complete or partial paralysis, brain damage, serious injury to virtually all internal
organs, serious injury to virtually all bones, joints, ligaments, muscles, tendons and
other aspects of the muscular skeletal system, and serious injury or impairment to other
aspects of my body, general health and well-being.&nbsp; I understand that the dangers and
risks of playing or practicing to play/participate in the above sport may result not only
in serious injury, but in a serious impairment of my future abilities to earn a living, to
engage in other business, social and recreational activities and generally to enjoy life.<br>
<br>
I also acknowledge that it is essential for my well-being that I not participate or
practice to play/participate in the above sport unless I am in good health and physical
condition.&nbsp; With this in mind, I have correctly answered the questions on the
attached Health Appraisal Form, and I have advised the Director of Sports Medicine/team
physician of any limitations on my activities for medical reasons.<br>
<br>
Because of the dangers of participating in the above sport, I recognize the importance of
following coaches' instructions regarding playing techniques, training and other team
rules, etc., and to agree to obey such instructions. I also recognize the importance of
following orders given by team physicians and athletic trainers regarding any limitations
or treatments they feel necessary for my health and well-being.<br>
<br>
In consideration of Miami University permitting me to try out for/participate on the Miami
University _____________________(sport) team and to engage in all activities related to
the team, including, but not limited to, trying out, practicing or playing/participating
in that sport, I hereby assume all the risks associated with participation and agree to
hold Miami University, its employees, agents, representatives, coaches, physicians,
athletic trainers and volunteers, harmless from any and all liability, actions, causes of
action, debts, claims or demand of any kind and nature whatsoever which may arise by or in
connection with my participation in any activities related to the Miami University
______________________(sport) team. The terms hereof shall serve as a release and
assumption of risk for my heirs, estate, executor, administrator, assignees, and for all
members of my family.</p>
