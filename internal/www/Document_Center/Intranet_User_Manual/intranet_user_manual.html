<CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+4>DON'T FORGET TO LOGOUT!</FONT></FONT></B>
<P><B>Before proceeding, the single most important thing to remember about
the MUSM Intranet is that you should always log out of the system when
you are finished using it.</B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><BR>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>BACKGROUND</FONT></B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=+2></FONT>
<P>The Miami University Sports Medicine (MUSM) Intranet was designed and
installed in 1998 by Melampus Enterprises, Inc., a healthcare intranet
consulting firm. Melampus periodically provides MUSM with system updates
and support.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<CENTER>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>LOGGING IN AND OUT</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>The URL (i.e. web address) of the main login page for the intranet is:
<CENTER>
<P><TT>https://musm.ica.muohio.edu/</TT></CENTER>

<P>The address is like most others you've probably seen before except for
the first part, which is the protocol type. For the Miami Intranet, we
are using a <I>secure</I> web protocol.&nbsp; So instead of http, you must
use <B>https</B>.
<P>When you load the address into the web browser, the login page will
be displayed. This "welcome" page is the only way into the Intranet. On
this page, you will be prompted for your login name and password. Enter
both of those (remembering that passwords are <B>case sensitive</B>), then
click on the Login button.
<P>When you login, you will see the Navigation frame on the left-hand side
of the window and your intranet homepage on the right-hand side. The Navigation
frame will always be there to allow you to jump to various pages on the
Intranet. Across the top of the browser window, you will see the MUSM Intranet
graphical header as well as the "Home" and "Logout" buttons. The "Home"
button will return you to your intranet homepage when you click on it.
The "Logout" button will display the Logout confirmation page, which allows
you to logout of the system.
<P>Once you have logged in, you are granted a <I>session key</I>. This
session key enables you to use the system for a specified amount of time
(currently set to 2 hours). If you stay logged in for longer than this
amount of time, the session key will expire and you will not be able to
continue until you re-login.
<P><B>It is extremely important to log out.</B> Otherwise, someone else
can use your account and view athlete records until the session key expires.
When you log out, your session key is deactivated.

<CENTER>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>PASSWORDS</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>It is important to choose a good password for your intranet account.
Keep in mind that your login ID (username) and password are the only mechanisms
by which you identify yourself to the Intranet. Therefore, if you permit
someone else to log in as you, then you will be held responsible for any
of their actions.
<P>In the same vein, if you choose a poor password, then someone may be
able to guess it and subsequently log in as you. Again, you will be held
responsible for this person's actions. A good password has the following
properties:
<UL>
<LI>
Not a word found in the dictionary</LI>

<LI>
Does not include any part of your name or login ID</LI>

<LI>
Uses upper and lower case letters</LI>

<LI>
Includes numbers and symbols in addition to letters</LI>
</UL>
To change your password, simply click on the "Change Password" link on
your intranet homepage (the page that first appears when you log in). You
will be prompted for your current password as well as the password you
would like to change it to. You need to type this in twice, to verify that
you typed it correctly. Your password will be checked to make sure it is
a good one. If it is rejected, then simply try again with a password which
has the properties listed above.
<P>Keep in mind that your login ID and password are separate from all other
systems at Miami. Therefore, if you change your MUSM Intranet password,
it will not affect your MIAVAX1 or your Eudora passwords.
<P>If you forget your Intranet password, then contact the on-staff intranet
administrator (currently Jennifer Beardslee). The administrator can reset
your password to a new one. Note that he/she cannot recover your password.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>ELECTRONIC&nbsp;MEDICAL&nbsp;RECORDS&nbsp;SYSTEM</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>The MUSM Intranet is a fully-functional electronic medical records system.
This fact necessitates an understanding of the security aspects involved
with such a system.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>Confidentiality</B>
<P>First and foremost, the medical records must be confidential and not
viewable by any person outside of the Sports Medicine staff. This quality
is achieved via the use of login ID's and passwords.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>Clearance Levels</B>
<P>A clearance level is assigned to each intranet user. There are a total
of four clearance levels: STUDENT, STAFF, PHYSICIAN, and ADMIN. For viewing
medical records, there are only two clearance levels that matter: STUDENT
and STAFF, and all intranet users must be one or the other. The difference
between the two is that STUDENT's are not permitted to view records marked
as confidential. Users with STUDENT&nbsp;clearance are, however, permitted
to enter records and designate them as confidential. In this case, the
user will not be able to view the form once it is submitted to the database.
<P>Every form in the system must be signed in order to enter it in the
database. Some forms, however, require a signature from a user with a particular
clearance level in order to be considered valid. Therefore when submitting
forms, there are three clearance levels that matter. The hierarchy of these
clearance levels is as follows:
<CENTER>
<P><B><TT>PHYSICIAN</TT></B>
<BR><B><TT>STAFF</TT></B>
<BR><B><TT>STUDENT</TT></B></CENTER>
<B><TT></TT></B>
<P>Thus, for example, there are forms that a STUDENT&nbsp;or STAFF can
enter, yet must ultimately be signed by a PHYSICIAN in order to be validated.
<P><B>NOTE</B>: Clearance levels are used elsewhere by the intranet to
determine what intranet utilities are available to that user. Users with
STAFF clearance are permitted to modify the Intranet Bulletin Board and
use the Freeform Query utility to submit queries to the database. Users
with ADMIN clearance can do those things as well as: use the Account Administration
utility, view account logs, purge archived athlete records, and modify
the Student Access IP&nbsp;address list.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>Data History</B>
<P>Another important aspect of a medical records system is the ability
to track all sources of data entered into the system as well as all modifications
to this data. To achieve this property, the interface to the database was
designed to restrict intranet users to insert-only access. That is, a user
is not permitted to update, modify, or delete any records in the system.
<P>Existing data can effectively be modified by creating a new "version"
of the form that supersedes the original. However, as a general rule, you
should never modify an existing form to enter new information. Instead,
always create a new form for new information. The only reason for editing
an existing form is to correct mistakes.
<P>A form's version history will be display at the bottom of the form when
it is viewed. Thus, one can review the history of the form as well as the
user who signed the form. Note that the data on a form may remain unchanged
from one version to another, with the only difference being the user signature
(most often when being validated by a user with the necessary clearance).

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>WHERE TO GO FOR HELP</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>If you encounter any problems arise while using the Intranet, you should
contact the MUSM Intranet Administrator (currently Jennifer Beardslee).&nbsp;
The administrator will either directly answer your question, or he/she
will contact Melampus for more information.
